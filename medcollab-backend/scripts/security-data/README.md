# Focused MongoDB/data security lane

Append-only VOCLE-786–816. Run **Vocle MongoDB Data Security** using workflow_dispatch on this fork's master. Production/Atlas/provider credentials are never required or permitted. The workflow installs dependencies/images before running the actual application and MongoDB in a network-none/shared-loopback namespace with a read-only source mount.

Local static checks from medcollab-backend:

```sh
node scripts/security-data/check.js
node scripts/security-data/self-test.js
node scripts/security-manifest-check.js
node scripts/security-media/check.js
node scripts/security-cloudinary/check.js
```

Also run `node --check` on this directory's JS files and inspect workflow YAML. `--freeze` deliberately creates the data manifest; do not use it to conceal changes to frozen IDs/expectations. Previous Cloudinary/media/general manifests remain pinned.

Full execution is `node scripts/security-data/run.js` **inside the workflow's disposable container environment**, not a command to run against a developer or production database. Exact URI/env/provider exclusions and loopback-only network guards fail closed. The runner verifies the local MongoDB TTL background sweep is paused so expired-record visibility assertions are deterministic. Real TTL index definitions/application expiry logic still execute; actual TTL deletion latency is deliberately not tested. Never apply the sweep setting to a deployed database.

`cases.js` separates HTTP, model/index and synthetic handler scopes. `fixtures.js` journals exact IDs and narrowly scopes generated OTP/inbox records to synthetic users, then verifies zero residue. `run.js` supervises the existing local-mode backend entrypoint, discards child logs and records sanitized booleans/counts/statuses. `check.js --artifacts` validates report hygiene/completeness before upload. Actual report exceptions, unsafe I/O, prerequisite failure, incomplete execution and cleanup failures block; unmet application requirements remain observations.

Successful route controls and state assertions must survive any remediation. Review/fix flow and secure gate activation are documented in [the release checklist](../../../docs/RELEASE_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md) and [data review](../../../docs/SECURITY_MONGODB_HARDENING_2026-10-06.md). No active strict application gate is supplied by this discovery runner.
