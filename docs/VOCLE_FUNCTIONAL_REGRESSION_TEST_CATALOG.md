# Vocle functional regression testcase catalog

Design revision: 8 October 2026. Source baseline and questions Q1–Q14 are defined in [master plan](VOCLE_FUNCTIONAL_REGRESSION_MASTER_PLAN.md). IDs are immutable. Cases are specifications, not executed results.

## How to implement each row

Each row specifies title/function, actions, observable expected result, tier/priority, coverage and clarification. The section's fixture/preconditions, dependencies and source references apply to **every row in that section**, unless overridden in the row. This inheritance avoids repeating setup and makes each specification complete. Ordered semicolon-separated actions are executed left to right. Each input boundary table is one case with named subchecks; reset the affected fixture between invalid variants.

**Universal assertions for NEW cases (retained sanity assertions remain frozen):** for every successful mutation, independently GET the affected resource/list and inspect DB where no read endpoint exists; compare IDs, field values and cardinalities, not only status. For rejected actions, snapshot affected collections before/after and assert no unintended mutation. Exceptions involving documented partial operations have a Q marker and do not assume atomicity. For socket expectations subscribe before mutation, await authentication/join acknowledgement, correlate resource and actor IDs, then poll persistence with a bounded deadline. No arbitrary sleeps, no retry-until-green mutations. Absence checks require a positive control and a bounded observation window after side-effect completion.

**Tier/feasibility:** B = real backend HTTP/Mongo/Socket automation, feasible with local fixtures; F = Flutter unit/widget/integration, feasible with fake repository/platform channels and controlled clocks; D = device automation requiring emulator/OS input harness. `Qn` marks an unresolved oracle: record current result separately and resolve before enforcing the disputed expectation. Unmarked cases require no product clarification. Priority P0 = core journey/data continuity, P1 = important regression, P2 = secondary behavior. All NEW cases are unimplemented; `partial:` names supporting existing coverage, not a duplicate completed test.

**Fixture profiles:**

- **U:** fresh database `vocle_regression_<run>_<module>` on isolated loopback, users A/B/C/D/E with reserved fictional phones +12025550101–105, OTP_BYPASS=false and captured fake SMS/widget responses. A owns S, B/C ordinary members; D unrelated and opts into requests only when stated; E unrelated/default opt-out. Users onboarded except authentication cases. Boundary group-size tests add synthetic users F–K. Use a separate S2 for lifecycle/destructive steps. No real patient/phone/provider data.
- **C:** U plus S default general/emergency/academics, custom public X, private Y with A only; pair DM A/B after accepted request; independent group A/B/C; two distinct roots r1/r2 and reply t1 with unique markers. Seed accepted prerequisite records only in independent component cases; journey cases must create through APIs.
- **H:** U+C plus draft A→B in S/general, fixed shift date 2030-01-02, night shift, patient `{bedNumber:'T1',ward:'Synthetic',clinicalAlias:'Case Alpha',status:'stable',notes:'review marker',pendingTasks:['check marker'],isFlagged:false}`, empty attachments. Create through POST /api/handoffs; retain returned patient/handoff IDs.
- **N:** C plus A and B sockets, B out of channel unless stated, notifications cleared only during fixture setup; stub push transport captures requests without network. Seed extra dated notifications for paging only.
- **M:** U plus valid tiny PNG, PDF and MP4 fixture bytes, unique filenames and SHA-256; local storage volume. Provider-path cases run a separate process with a test-owned SDK/transport fake, dummy config and no egress. Do not fetch inert Cloudinary URLs.
- **F0:** fresh Flutter dependencies, authenticated A, fake API/repositories/socket streams, isolated preferences/secure-storage doubles, deterministic IDs/times. Recreate service/widget to verify persistence. Real backend is required only for D journeys.
- **D0:** test build on emulator/device, local synthetic backend and seeded identities, injectable OS notification/picker events, no production configuration; record OS/build/device and backend SHA. Restart app without deleting storage for persistence checks.

Backend route files beside controllers are the authoritative method/path contracts. Exact boundary lengths below come from validators/models. Assertions of an intended invariant that conflicts with source are explicitly Q-marked; do not encode the defect as desired behavior.

## Retained sanity cases: 48 unchanged IDs

All rows below: coverage **EXISTING**, tier **B**, priority **P0**, feasible using existing harness; dependencies are their group fixture and earlier resources explicitly used in actions. Preserve existing source assertions verbatim, including failures. These rows summarize the existing executable definitions; adding stronger assertions belongs under new IDs. Each group links its exact implementation, which supplies literal request payloads and response assertions.

## Cross-feature journeys (not extra feature modules)

U+C+H through public APIs for B; D0 uses actual UI and local backend. Dependencies are explicit chain order; failures block later steps, while independent component cases still run. Sources are the participating module anchors above. No model seeding may substitute the operation validated by the journey.

## Guardrails for implementation

Do not treat question-marked rows as expected failures or accept source bugs as desired contracts. Split verified subassertions from unresolved ones in reports, keeping this stable parent ID. Preserve the 48 existing IDs and existing failure gates. Existing Flutter unit coverage is credited as partial, not as completed widget/device proof. No route count, successful upload alone, or healthy backend proves a mobile workflow.
